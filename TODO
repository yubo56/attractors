Petrovich presentation from Iceland?
Millholland & Laughlin WASP12b

Maybe consider basin of attraction for CS2 w/ nonzero eps?
Sarah's thoughts: 1) effect of planet-planet vs planet-disk
    2) g from planet-star (as fat young star spins down) vs g from planet-planet
        - two crossings!
    3) nonzero eccentricity of course
backreaction terms and/or s ~ 1 (Kassandra's paper?)


Schlicting high velocity impacts to motivate using large q_sp 1811.11778
Look up real alpha numbers (kepler papers)



Paper notes:
Pitch as both solving disk problem over larger ICs but also has wide range of
applications
Maximum-period orbit to update epsilon criterion?
Explain coordinate choice somewhere
Move S 3.3: Quasi-adiabatic/effect of nonadiabiticity (show more than just 12)
    - delete probs for the rest of these
S2: need epsilon + values
