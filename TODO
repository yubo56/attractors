Petrovich presentation from Iceland?
Millholland & Laughlin WASP12b

Maybe consider basin of attraction for CS2 w/ nonzero eps?
Sarah's thoughts: 1) effect of planet-planet vs planet-disk
    2) g from planet-star (as fat young star spins down) vs g from planet-planet
        - two crossings!
    3) nonzero eccentricity of course
backreaction terms and/or s ~ 1 (Kassandra's paper?)


Schlicting high velocity impacts to motivate using large q_sp 1811.11778
Look up real alpha numbers (kepler papers)



Paper notes:
Pitch as both solving disk problem over larger ICs but also has wide range of
applications
Maximum-period orbit to update epsilon criterion?
Explain coordinate choice somewhere
Move S 3.3: Quasi-adiabatic/effect of nonadiabiticity (show more than just 12)
    - delete probs for the rest of these
S2: need epsilon + values

- Fig 1.5: theta(eta) + eta_c, make sure consistent colors
- Fig 2: change everything else to Roman numerals, probably show for multiple
  eta
- Fig 3: label eta_c
- Fig 4-7: Can label C+- for "sep"? can trunc eta = 1e-3
    - delete axhline('r') in ax1
    - don't need to show multiple trajectories in ax2 when not sep cross
    - change separatrix crossing to before + after, separate panels (like
      Natalia), make sure separatrix positioning for before/after are good! 5
      total panels
    - make bounds [0, 2pi] on fig b
    - why isn't sep always dashed?
    - make colorings consistent w/ earlier figs
    - single caption, should explain what the \Delta As equate to in each case
****- Fig 4: why not adiabatic at beginning?
- Fig 8: just theta, not flipped theta
    - delete naive, or at least rename
