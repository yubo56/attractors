Maybe consider basin of attraction for CS2 w/ nonzero eps?
backreaction terms and/or s ~ 1 (Kassandra's paper?)

Two goals: 1) to understand Millholland, but also
2) possibility of application to many other problems (think about possible other
applications), "general dynamics problem has wide range of apps"

New paper: whether can be trapped in resonance, and whether is stable
(stability/fragility)
- can check timescale of how long-lived the resonance is, once captured
- bifurcation in spin periods, but also what fraction live in these high
  obliquity states
