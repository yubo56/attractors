Reviewer's Comments:
This paper explores the dynamics of "Colombo's top" problem, which involves the motion of a planet's spin axis while its orbit undergoes uniform orbital precession due to a perturber. The dynamics are envisioned to take place early on in the system's lifetime, and the perturber is the protoplanetary disk. As the disk loses mass, a spin-orbit resonance is crossed, and the planetary obliquity is excited. While Colombo's top is not a new set-up, this paper presents several new and interesting components of the general problem. Overall, I think the authors do a great job with their analytical explorations, as all components are very thorough, and they appear correct as far as I can tell. My comments here are generally minor and are mostly directed at enhancing clarity for the readers, since the paper is fairly technically-challenging. I will present the most substantial comments first, before moving onto the more minor ones.

1) Given that Colombo's top problem has been studied in much previous literature, it would be helpful to specify more explicitly which parts of this paper are completely novel (particularly regarding the phase space area evolution in the adiabatic regime).
2) This is primarily a matter of preference, but I suggest considering the usage of the polar depiction of the phase space, as opposed to using \phi and \cos\theta as the x and y axes. The polar view can assist in seeing where and when the separatrix emerges. In addition, the calculations of phase space areas tend to be more intuitive, and it could also help the reader better interpret the scenarios in Figures 8-11.
3) There is an interesting difference between separatrix crossings that change the obliquity with an impulsive and large jump (e.g. III->I, III->II->I) versus those that do not affect the obliquity evolution in a significant way (e.g. II->I, II->III). Is this distinction fundamental enough to be emphasized in the text?
4) The whole set-up assumes a single planet in the disk. Can the authors comment (briefly) on what changes when multiple planets are present? Similarly, are there any interesting dependencies on the timing at which the resonance encounter occurs? (E.g. closer planets encounter the resonance earlier than more distant ones.)

Smaller comments:
- State references for equations 3 and 4.
- In equation 3 and 4, it is more customary in previous literature to label k_2 = 3 k_{qp}, where k_2 is the Love number. In addition, conventional notation for k_p is \lambda or C.
- In equations 17, A_2 should be labeled A_{II}.
- Please cite the references you used for equations 14, 15, 16, and 17. Much of equations 16 and 17, for example, are written in the notation of Ward & Hamilton (2004).
- Add a legend with the colors of the Cassini states in Figure 3. (It's not easy to remember them from the previous figure.)
- Figure 4 is plotted for I=5 deg, correct? Can you please include this in the figure caption? Also in Figure 4, it would be helpful to label the allowed regions for each of the separatrix crossing sequences, as delineated/summarized in the left column of page 9. Finally, it would also be helpful to include an additional y-axis label in Figure 4 for \theta_sd, given the equation 23 relation between \theta_sd and the initial phase space area. This can help the reader understand why each evolutionary track can only occur for a distinct range of \theta_sd.
- Figures 6 and 7 look very similar, and it does not seem to add much to have both of them. I would suggest either removing one or making Figure 7 an even larger angle than I=20 deg.
- In section 3.2.2, whenever the probability is between 0 and 1, how does the phase factor into determining which track the system ends up following? Is the phase the only factor that influences which side the trajectory will come out on?
- There is an extra partial derivative at the top of page 8 shortly before equation 30.
- Whether the area A_I is positive or negative depends on the direction of the trajectory in the phase space. It would be helpful to clarify this in a couple areas in Section 3.2.3. It is understandable upon examination of the figures, but at first look at the text, it is confusing why area A_I is sometimes denoted as negative (e.g. just before equation 26) and other times positive (e.g. just before equation 28).
- On Figures 8-11 and 14, it might be helpful to maintain a uniform y-axis range, since the evolution of the phase space and separatrix crossings would be clearer.
- In Figure 13, why does the vertical banding not extend all the way to the green III->I track? Is it because the libration cycles deviate more strongly from circular in this regime?
