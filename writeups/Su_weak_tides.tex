\section{Introduction}

Separatrix crossing was studied by \citep{henrard1982}.

\section{Theory and Equations}\label{s:theory}

We study an oblate planet orbiting around a star hosting a further out planet.
The equations of motion in the absence of dissipation are:

We define $s_c$ to be the critical spin where the precession frequencies
$\omega_{s1}$ and $\omega_{21}$ are equal, or:

Throughout this paper, we often set the orbital frequency of the inner planet
$\Omega_1 = 1$.

\subsection{Cassini States}\label{ss:cs_theory}

Equilibria of spin dynamics are \emph{Cassini States} (CSs). Refer to Su \& Lai
2020 for more detailed discussion. In the notation of the previous paper,
\begin{equation}
    \eta = s_c / s.
\end{equation}

Plots of CS locations as always.

Note that $\phi$ is conjugate to $\cos \theta$, and thus the spin dynamics
exhibit Hamiltonian:

Plot of level curves of Hamiltonian, including $\mathcal{C}_{\pm}$ notation.

\subsection{Weak Tidal Friction}\label{ss:weak_tides}

We use the weak tidal friction model \citep{lai2012}. The EOM for $\theta, s$
become:

The phase portrait for these EOM in $\p{s, \theta}$ space is shown in
Fig.~flow-diagram.

% \label{fig:flow-diagram}

TODO overplot CS1, CS2 for two values of $s_c$. TODO show on plot the location
where tides are so strong that CS2 ecomes unstable (is the only
$\epsilon$-dependent result of the paper).

\subsection{Stable Equilibria of Tidal Friction}\label{ss:tidal_eqs}

Generally, these EOM have equilibria at the points that are both a CS and
satisfy $\dot{s} = 0$ under weak tidal friction. These are stable as $\epsilon
\to 0$, see Appendix~\ref{app:cs_stab}. On Fig.~flow-diagram, these are the
intersection of the locations of CS1 and CS2 with the line $\dot{s} = 0$. It is
clear that the locations of these equilibria depend on the value of $s_c$. Call
these generalized equilibria \emph{tidal Cassini States} (tCS), and number them
tCS1 and tCS2 depending on whether they are CS1 or CS2 states.

Furthermore, if tides are too strong (large $\epsilon$), CS2 can become
unstable (cite Fabrycky). This can be quantified as:

\section{Probability Distribution of Outcomes}\label{s:sim}

The general question of the dynamics is then as follows: given problem
parameters (including $s_c$) and an initial planet spin and obliquity $(s,
\theta)$, what are the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities? We
study this first at fixed $s_c$ as a function of $\theta$ in
Section~\ref{ss:q_dist}, then as a function of $s_c$ for an isotropic initial
spin $\hat{s}$ in Section~\ref{ss:s_c_dist}.

\subsection{Distribution As a Function of $\theta$}\label{ss:q_dist}

As a result of \autoref{ss:tidal_eqs}, the tCS are the only possible final
outcomes. We generate initial spin vectors $\hat{s}$ for isotropic initial
distribution $\p{\cos \theta, \phi}$, and marginalize over $\phi$ (which
generally cannot be fixed by any formation mechanism) in histograms:

% Three primary regimes: $s_c \ll 1$ (CS2 rare), $\simeq 1$ (CS2 is substantial
% and probable), $\gg 1$ (CS2 = I, uninteresting)

The governing mechanism for these probabilities is probabilistic separatrix
crossing, which is covered in Appendix~\ref{app:probs}. The calculation is
difficult analytically, but can be performed semi-analytically (describe
procedure here, calculate $\eta_{\star}$ numerically etc.). The agreement of
this curve with the histograms is examined for the same three $s_c$ values
below:

\subsection{Distribution As a Function of $s_c$}\label{ss:s_c_dist}

Assuming that $\hat{s}$ is drawn from an isotropic distribution, we may then
calculate the probabilities of going to either tCS as a function of $s_c$. This
is shown below:

Note that while only the results for an isotropic distribution of initial
$\hat{s}$ are shown, in principle arbitrary distributions $P\p{\theta_i}$ can be
convolved against the $P_{tCS2}\p{\theta_i}$ distributions shown in
\autoref{ss:q_dist}.

\subsection{Theory}\label{app:sep_crossing_dynamics}

\subsubsection{Application of Adiabatic Invariance: Henrard Theory}

Review Henrard result, is already very successful e.g.\ MMR capture.

\subsubsection{Melnikov Integral}\label{sss:Melnikov}

The first substantial new result.

\subsection{Example: Constant $s$}

``Toy problem 1'', the nice $P_c \propto \eta^{3/2}$ result. Application of
Section~\ref{sss:Melnikov}.

\subsection{Separatrix Crossing Probability: Tidal Friction}\label{app:probs}

Application of the full formula presented in
Section~\ref{app:sep_crossing_dynamics}. The key result is that one integrates

% $\Delta_{\pm}$ equation

The capture probabilities are then

% $P_c = \Delta \pm \dots$

An analytical form that holds when $s \gg s_c$ is:

% ugly approximate form
